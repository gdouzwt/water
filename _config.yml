# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  这是单独开的一个子域名博客，记录一件事而已，就是使用超声波测距模块整合到运行OpenWrt的路由器、米家智能网关，
  实现的一个水塔液位自动控制系统，用于家中抽水机的控制。因为是有在使用的东西，就打算记录清楚一点，方便以后维护。
